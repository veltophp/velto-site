Prerequisites
-------------

**Before getting started with VeltoPHP, make sure you have:**

PHP 8.1 or higher
-----------------
VeltoPHP relies on modern PHP features, so version 8.1 or above is required to ensure full compatibility.

Composer version 2.x
--------------------
Composer is used to install VeltoPHP and its dependencies. Make sure it's installed on your system.

Code editor (VSCode, Sublime Text ,etc)
---------------------------------------
You'll be writing PHP and view files, so use a code editor that supports syntax highlighting and autocomplete for PHP.

Internet connection
-------------------
Required during initial installation to download VeltoPHP via Composer.

Basic PHP knowledge (including OOP)
-----------------------------------
You should understand basic PHP syntax like variables and functions, plus simple OOP concepts such as classes, objects, and methods â€” as VeltoPHP is structured around object-oriented code in many parts.
