Introduction
------------
**Welcome to the official documentation for VeltoPHP**  — a lightweight and modern PHP framework designed to accelerate web development without sacrificing structure or flexibility. VeltoPHP was built from the ground up to fulfill the need for a simple, efficient, and developer-friendly framework that can handle both small and scalable web projects.

At its core, VeltoPHP uses the **RVC (Route-View-Controller)** architecture, offering a fast and intuitive way to build applications with minimal setup. For developers who need a more structured and powerful approach, VeltoPHP supports **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** through an optional extension called **Axion**, which can be enabled based on your project’s complexity.

This documentation is your complete guide to understanding, installing, and building applications with VeltoPHP — from the basics to advanced features. Whether you're new to PHP or an experienced developer looking for a clean and flexible foundation, VeltoPHP is here to support your next web project.
