csrf_token()
------------


The **csrf_token()** helper function is used to generate and retrieve a secure Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) token. CSRF tokens are essential in web applications to protect forms and sensitive actions from unauthorized requests made by malicious sites. This function ensures a unique token is created per session and reused until the session ends.

You can use the **csrf_token()** function anywhere in your application where you need to embed a CSRF token, typically inside HTML forms. This token can be validated later when the form is submitted to ensure the request is genuine.


Generate and use token in an HTML form:
---------------------------------------

```bash

<form method="POST" action="{{route('submit.form')}}">
    <input type="hidden" name="_token" value="{{csrf_token()}}">
    # Other form fields
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>

```


Sample output:
--------------

```bash
<input type="hidden" name="_token" value="a94c32f8ae8272b376f97e8d1a4d5ee0e4cfd6bb6baf9178c877dcf59358f0b3">
```
