base_path()
-----------

**What It Does**

**The base_path()** function returns the absolute path to the vendor directory where VeltoPHP is installed. You can optionally pass a relative path to append to it.

It works by going up three directory levels from the helper's location, which is typically inside **vendor/veltophp/velto-core**. This makes it useful for resolving paths relative to the VeltoPHP core itself â€” not the root of your application project.

How to Use It
-------------

Call base_path() with or without an argument:

- Without an argument: returns the absolute path to the vendor/ directory.
- With a relative path: appends that path to the base vendor directory.


Example Usage
--------------

```bash

# Get the vendor directory path
$vendorPath = base_path();
echo $vendorPath;

# Output: /var/www/your-project/vendor


# Get the full path to the velto-core folder
$corePath = base_path('veltophp/velto-core');
echo $corePath;

# Output: /var/www/your-project/vendor/veltophp/velto-core


```
