What Are Helpers in VeltoPHP?
-----------------------------


**Helpers in VeltoPHP** are simple, globally accessible utility functions designed to make your development process faster, cleaner, and more expressive.

They allow you to perform common tasks—like working with URLs, sessions, CSRF tokens, redirects, and more views—without having to write repetitive or verbose code.

Why Use Helpers?
-----------------

- Simplify syntax: **No need to call long class methods or resolve dependencies**.

- Increase productivity: **Do more with fewer lines**.

- Consistent behavior: **All helpers are built-in and optimized for the VeltoPHP core**.
