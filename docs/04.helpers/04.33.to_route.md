to_route()
----------


In many web frameworks, including your own custom framework or even others, redirecting to a named route with flash data can often look something like this:

```bash
return redirect()->route('dashboard')->with('success', 'Logged in successfully.');
```

While this is perfectly fine, it can become unnecessarily verbose, especially if you're repeating it across multiple controllers. It also requires chaining multiple methods, which adds complexity to something that should be simple.

That’s why we introduce a simplified helper: **to_route()**.


Simplified Redirection
----------------------

**Instead of writing:**

```bash
redirect()->route('profile.edit');
```


**You can simply write:**

```bash
to_route('profile.edit');
```

This achieves the same outcome — redirecting to a named route and passing flash data — but with cleaner syntax and fewer method chains.


Benefits of Using to_route()
----------------------------

- Shorter and cleaner code
- No method chaining required
- Flash data included in a single step
- Easier to read and maintain


Summary:
--------


Writing **redirect()->route(...)** each time is too long and repetitive.

So instead, we provide a more concise and expressive way with **to_route(...)**.

It keeps your controller logic clean and readable — and makes your framework feel more intuitive to use.
