real_path()
-----------

**What It Does**

**The real_path()** function converts a given relative path (relative to the web serverâ€™s document root) into an absolute, canonical filesystem path. Since **$_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']** usually points to the public directory of your VeltoPHP project, this function resolves paths relative to the public folder.

It ensures the resolved path is absolute and normalized **(resolving any symbolic links or relative segments)**.

How to Use It
-------------

Pass a relative path starting from the public directory **(without a leading slash) to real_path()**. The function appends this to the document root and returns the absolute path if it exists, or false if it does not.

Example Usage
-------------

```bash
# Assuming DOCUMENT_ROOT is /var/www/project/public

# Get absolute path to a CSS file inside public/css
$cssPath = real_path('css/style.css');
echo $cssPath;
# Output: /var/www/project/public/css/style.css (if file exists)

# Non-existing file returns false
$missingFile = real_path('images/missing.jpg');
var_dump($missingFile);
# Output: bool(false)

```
