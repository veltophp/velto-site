view_path()
-----------


What It Does
------------

The **view_path()** function resolves the full file path to a view file based on a dot-notation string **(e.g., "home.index").** It transforms the dot notation into a proper directory structure and appends the .vel.php file extension, which is the default for VeltoPHP views.

If the view file does not exist, the function throws a RuntimeException.

How to Use It
-------------

Pass the name of the view using dot notation **(e.g., folder.filename)**, and it will return the full path to that view file inside the **views/** directory.

Internally, it uses the base_path() function to look inside the vendor directory, where VeltoPHP views are expected to be located by default.


Example Usage
-------------

```bash

# Returns the full path to: vendor/views/home/index.vel.php
$view = view_path('home.index');
echo $view;
# Output: /var/www/project/vendor/views/home/index.vel.php

# If the file doesn't exist, it throws an exception:
$view = view_path('not.found');
# Output: RuntimeException: View [not.found] not found at: /var/www/project/vendor/views/not/found.vel.php

```
