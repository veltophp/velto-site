request()
---------


What it does
------------

The **request()** function is a global helper that returns a singleton instance of the Request class. This class is responsible for handling all HTTP request data, such as form inputs **(POST)**, query parameters **(GET)**, server data, headers, and the request method.

By using a static variable internally, this function ensures that only one Request object is created during the entire lifecycle of a request. This improves performance and memory usage, while also providing consistent access to the request data across your application.

This approach follows the singleton pattern, which is a common design pattern used to share a single instance of a class globally without having to manually instantiate it each time.

How to use it
-------------

You can call **request()** from anywhere in your application—whether it's a **controller, middleware, or even a view—without** needing to manually create a new Request object. Once called, it provides methods to retrieve request input, check request types **(e.g., GET or POST)**, or access server variables.


Example usage in controller
---------------------------

In this example, we’re using the **request()** helper to access all the data submitted through a form. Here’s a breakdown of how it works:

Retrieve all input data using request()->all()
----------------------------------------------

```bash

public function contactSend()
{

    # use request()
    $request = request()->all();

    dd($request);
}


```

The method **request()->all()** returns all the submitted form data. For instance, if the form contains fields like name, email, and message, the output of dd($request); will look like this:

Here the dd($request); result
----------------------------

```bash

array (
  '_token' => '003d45ad1cdf40cddb5199fd5aa99ee250add8cb75e17a67f2772a07b3c94ffd',
  'name' => 'John Doe',
  'email' => 'johndoe@mail.com',
  'message' => 'Hello from John Doe!',
)

```

- _token: is the CSRF token automatically included for security.
- name, email, and message: are values submitted by the user from the contact form.


Extract only the necessary data
--------------------------------

Here we’re creating a new $data array that contains only the relevant fields, excluding _token. This makes it easier to use for database insertion, sending emails, or further processing.

```bash

$data = [
    'name' => $request['name'],
    'email' => $request['email'],
    'message' => $request['message'],
];

dd($data);

```

Here the dd($data); result
----------------------------

```bash

array (
  'name' => 'John Doe',
  'email' => 'johndoe@mail.com',
  'message' => 'Hello from John Doe!',
)

```

Why is this useful?
--------------------

- The **request()** helper gives you a clean and consistent way to access user input, without relying on raw **$_POST** or **$_GET** arrays.

- It keeps your controller logic simple and readable.

- It also makes your application easier to maintain, test, and secure.
