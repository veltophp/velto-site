markdown() 
----------

**What It Does**
The markdown() function converts a string written in Markdown syntax into safe HTML. It uses the **CommonMarkConverter** from the **League/CommonMark** library to handle the transformation.

**It ensures:**


Unsafe HTML is stripped **('html_input' => 'strip')**

Unsafe links are not allowed **('allow_unsafe_links' => false)**

This function is especially useful when rendering user-generated content or documentation that needs to be stored in Markdown format but displayed as HTML.

How to Use It
-------------

Just pass a Markdown-formatted string into the markdown() function. It will return the corresponding HTML string.

Make sure the **league/commonmark** package is installed via Composer:

```bash
composer require league/commonmark
```

Example Usage
-------------

```bash

use League\CommonMark\CommonMarkConverter;

$text = "# Hello World\nThis is a **bold** text and this is *italic*.";

echo markdown($text);
```

Output
------

```bash
<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>This is a <strong>bold</strong> text and this is <em>italic</em>.</p>
```
