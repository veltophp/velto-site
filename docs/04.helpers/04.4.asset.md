asset()
-------


What It Does
------------

The **asset()** function generates a URL path to a public asset **(such as a CSS file, JavaScript file, image, etc.)** stored inside the public/ directory of your VeltoPHP project. It ensures the given path is correctly prefixed with **/public/.**


How to Use It
-------------

Pass the relative path of the asset you want to reference **(e.g., css/style.css, images/logo.png)**. The function returns the corresponding URL path, making it easy to embed assets in your HTML.

**Note**: This assumes your server is set up to serve files from the **/public** directory.


Example Usage
-------------

```bash

# Get the URL to a CSS file
$cssUrl = asset('css/app.css');
echo $cssUrl;

# Output: /public/css/app.css


# Get the URL to an image
$imgUrl = asset('images/logo.png');
echo $imgUrl;

# Output: /public/images/logo.png


```
