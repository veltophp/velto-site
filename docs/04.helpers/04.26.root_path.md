root_path()
-----------

**The root_path()** function returns the full absolute path to the main folder of your VeltoPHP project â€” the folder that contains all your application files, configurations, and resources. It calculates this path by moving up four directory levels from the location of the current file where the function is defined. This method ensures that no matter where your code is executed or included from, you always get the correct root folder path of your project.

This is especially useful when you need to build file paths dynamically, include files, or perform filesystem operations relative to the project root without hardcoding any paths.


How to Use It
-------------

Call root_path() with or without a relative path argument:

- Without arguments: **returns the project root directory.**
- With a relative path: **appends the given path to the root directory.**


Example Usage
--------------

```bash

# Get the project root directory
$root = root_path();
echo $root;

# Output: /var/www/project


# Get the full path to the storage folder inside the project root
$storage = root_path('storage/logs');
echo $storage;

# Output: /var/www/project/storage/logs

```
