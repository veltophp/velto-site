dump()
------


What It Does
------------

The **dump()** function is a debugging helper that allows you to inspect one or more variables in a clean and readable way without stopping script execution. It’s similar to **dd()**, but intended for non-fatal inline debugging, useful when you want to monitor variable values without halting the page.

Key Features
------------

Outputs variables in a styled HTML container.

- Renders multiple variables, each inside its own block.
- Shows the file and line number where dump() was called.
- Does not terminate script execution — your code continues to run.


Example Usage
-------------


```bash

$name = 'VeltoPHP';
$config = ['debug' => true, 'version' => '1.0'];

dump($name, $config);

echo "This line will still execute.";

```

This renders an easy-to-read debug panel with both variables shown, and the script proceeds normally afterward.


Example in a Controller
-----------------------

```bash

class HomeController extends Controller

{

    public function index()
    {

        $title = 'Velto';

        # Show but don't stop
        dump($title);

        return view('home', ['title' => $title]);

    }
)

```

Output Styling
---------------


Light background for minimal distraction.

- Syntax-safe display using **print_r() + htmlspecialchars().**
- Each variable is wrapped in a styled block.
- Call location is displayed in a header **(file + line number).**


When to Use
------------


Use **dd()** when:
- You want to stop execution immediately and debug deeply.

Use **dump()** when:
- You just want to inspect variables without interrupting the flow.
