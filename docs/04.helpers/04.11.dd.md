dd()

What It Does
-----------

The **dd()** (Dump and Die) function is a debugging utility used to instantly dump the contents of one or more variables and halt further script execution. It displays the output in a beautifully formatted and styled fullscreen HTML view, making it easier to inspect variables during development.

This is especially helpful when debugging deeply nested arrays, objects, or large datasets.

How to Use It
-------------

You simply call **dd()** and pass any number of variables to it. The function will:

- Render a fullscreen dark-themed panel.
- Show each variable with syntax-highlighted formatting.
- Stop the script after rendering.
- Display the exact file and line number where dd() was called.


Example Usage
-------------

```bash

$user = [
    'name' => 'Jane Doe',
    'email' => 'jane@example.com',
    'roles' => ['admin', 'editor'],
];

dd($user);


```

You can also pass multiple variables:

```bash

dd($user, $posts, $settings);

```

This will display each variable as a separate debug block with clear labeling like **“Variable #1”, “Variable #2”,** and so on.


Example in a Controller
-----------------------

```bash

class HomeController extends Controller

{

    public function index()
    {

        $title = 'Velto';

        dd($title);

        return view('home', ['title' => $title]);

    }
)


```

Output Details
---------------

- The dump panel covers the entire screen to make focus easier.
- A header and footer provide context **(VeltoPHP label and file info).**
- Uses **var_export()** and **htmlspecialchars()** for readable and safe HTML output.


When to Use
------------


Use **dd()** when:
- You want to stop execution immediately and debug deeply.

Use **dump()** when:
- You just want to inspect variables without interrupting the flow.
