view()

What It Does
------------

The **view()** function is a helper that renders a view template file and returns the result as a string. Internally, it calls **View::render()** and passes the view name and any associated data. This function simplifies the process of returning HTML views from your controllers or routes.

View names use dot notation, which translates to directory paths. For example, **'home.index'** refers to the file **views/home/index.vel.php.**

You can also pass an associative array of data, which will be extracted and made available as variables within the view file.

How to Use It
--------------


Call **view()** by specifying:

- The view file name in dot notation **(without the .vel.php extension)**
- An optional associative array of data to inject into the view


Example Usage in a Controller
-----------------------------

```bash

class HomeController
{
    public function index()
    {
        $title = 'Welcome to VeltoPHP';
        $description = 'VeltoPHP is a lightweight PHP framework.';

        return view('home.index', [
            'title' => $title,
            'description' => $description,
        ]);
    }
}

```

Inside the View: views/home/index.vel.php
-----------------------------------------

```bash

<h1>{{$title}}</h1>
<p>{{$description}}</p>

```


Output
------

```bash

<h1>Welcome to VeltoPHP</h1>
<p>VeltoPHP is a lightweight PHP framework.</p>


```
