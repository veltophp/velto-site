csrf_verify()
-------------


The **csrf_verify()** helper function is responsible for verifying the validity of a CSRF token submitted with a form request. It compares the incoming token with the one stored in the session using a secure comparison method. This function is executed internally by the VeltoPHP backend during request handling.

As a developer, you do not need to call **csrf_verify()** manually. VeltoPHP automatically invokes this function behind the scenes during **POST** or **GET** requests to ensure the submitted CSRF token matches the one generated for the session.

This internal verification adds a layer of security to protect your application from CSRF attacks without requiring any additional code on your part.

Code Example
-------------

No direct implementation is needed. The framework handles CSRF verification internally.

**However, behind the scenes, VeltoPHP runs logic similar to this:**

```bash

$submittedToken = $_POST['_token'] ?? '';
$isValid = csrf_verify($submittedToken);

if (!$isValid) {
    # VeltoPHP will automatically block the request
}

```

*But again, this is handled automatically.*

The **csrf_verify()** function powers VeltoPHP's CSRF protection mechanism by securely checking tokens submitted with form requests. It works automatically within the framework, so developers donâ€™t need to worry about manual validation. Just use **csrf_field()** in your forms, and VeltoPHP takes care of the rest.
