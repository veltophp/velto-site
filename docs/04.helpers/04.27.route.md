route()
-------


The **route()** helper function is a core part of VeltoPHP's routing system, designed to help developers generate fully qualified URLs to named routes in a clean, consistent, and flexible way.

This eliminates the need to hard-code URLs throughout your application, making your codebase easier to maintain and less error-prone.

Purpose of route()
-------------------

Instead of writing:

```bash
<a href="/product/15/detail">View</a>
```

the result is

```bash
<a href="/product/15/detail">View</a>
```

NOTE
----

This works, but it's hardcoded. If your route ever changes **(/product/{id}/detail → /produk/{id}/info)**, you'd have to manually update every instance.

So, you can write:

```bash
<a href="{{route('product.detail', ['id' => 15])}}">View</a>
```

the result is

```bash
<a href="http://yourdomain.com/product/15/detail">View</a>
```

NOTE
----

- The URL is dynamically generated.
- It uses the current domain (auto-detects http or https).
- The {id} placeholder is replaced with the value 15.
- It's safer, centralized, and easier to maintain.


Example Use Cases
-----------------

**1. In Controller**

```bash
public function update()
{
    return redirect()->route('user.edit', ['id' => 7]);
}
```


**2. In Views**

```bash
<a href="{{route('post.show', ['slug' => 'hello-world'])}}">Read Post</a>
```

**3. Complex Routes:**

For something like:
```bash
'category.item' => '/category/{category}/item/{id}'
```

**You can write:**
```bash
route('category.item', ['category' => 'books', 'id' => 3]);
```

**Will generate:**
```bash
https://yourdomain.com/category/books/item/3
```


Final Summary
--------------

The **route()** helper is a core utility in VeltoPHP that:

- Simplifies building URLs dynamically
- Makes your codebase cleaner and easier to maintain
- Supports modern routing needs **(dynamic segments, secure URLs)**
- nhances developer productivity with useful error feedback

It plays a crucial role in integrating routing with controllers, views, and redirection logic — making it a foundation of your full web stack.
