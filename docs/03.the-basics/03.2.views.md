Introduction
------------

Returning raw HTML directly from your routes or controllers is rarely practical — especially as your application grows. That’s why VeltoPHP comes with its own lightweight and expressive view system: **Vel-view engine.**

Vel-view allows you to keep your HTML and PHP logic in clean, reusable templates stored in the **views/** directory at the root of your project.

example of view name :
```bash
home.vel.php
```

```bash
# View stored in views/home.vel.php

<html>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello, {{ $name }}</h1>
    </body>
</html>
```
Vel-view uses **{{ }}** to echo variables safely, similar to other modern templating engines. It’s simple, intuitive, and doesn't require learning a new syntax beyond standard PHP.


Returning a View from a Route
-----------------------------

To return this view from a route, use the **view()** helper function in your route or controller:

```bash
use Velto\Core\Route;

Route::get('/', function () {
    return view('home', ['name' => 'John Doe']);
});
```

The **view()** helper automatically looks for the file in your **views/**  folder and expects the **.vel.php** extension.


View File Naming Convention
---------------------------

VeltoPHP expects your view files to follow this format:

- **Folder: views/**

- **Extension: .vel.php**

- **Example: views/home.vel.php**

or with folder

- **Example: views/home/index.vel.php**

```bash
# This will render views/home/index.vel.php

return view('home/index'); 

or 

return view('home.index');
```


Why Vel-view?
-------------

**Vel-view** is designed to be fast, minimal, and developer-friendly — perfect for small to medium-scale projects. It provides just enough features to keep your UI dynamic, without the overhead of a full templating engine.


Layout System
-------------

**VeltoPHP** comes with its own **Vel-view engine**, a lightweight, clean, and expressive templating engine designed for simplicity and speed. One of its core features is the Layout System, which allows developers to define a master page **(layout)** and reuse it across multiple views — keeping code DRY and maintainable.

Purpose of Layouts
------------------

Layouts let you create a consistent HTML structure (such as <head>, navigation bar, and footer) and inject dynamic content into specific parts of that layout using special directives. This separates content logic from design.


Folder Convention: layouts/ Only
--------------------------------

**Important:**
VeltoPHP is preconfigured to only look for layout files inside the ***views/layouts/ folder.***

```bash
your-project/
└── views/
    └── layouts/
        └── app.vel.php   ← valid layout file
        └── guest.vel.php  ← another valid layout file

```

You cannot store layout files in other folders **(e.g., views/partials/ or views/home/)** because VeltoPHP will not recognize them as layouts. This convention ensures performance and clarity in view resolution.

**For example:**

```bash
@extends('layouts.app') // ✅ valid
@extends('home.customlayout') // ❌ will not work
```


Defining a Layout
-----------------

**VeltoPHP** uses template inheritance with layout files. Here's how it works:

```bash

# Layout View Template (your-project/views/layouts/app.vel.php):

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>@yield('title', 'default title')</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        @yield('content')
    </body>
</html>

```

- **@yield('title')** is a placeholder for the page title.

- **@yield('content')** will contain the main body content from child views.


Using the Layout in Views
-------------------------

```bash

# View Template (your-project/views/home.vel.php):

@extends('layouts.app')

@section('title')
    Some Title that will replace the default title
@endsection

@section('content')
    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p>This is our home page content.</p>
@endsection


```

This view file extends the app layout and injects its custom title and content.

Summary
-------

```bash

| Feature          | Description                                    |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `@extends`       | Inherit a layout from `views/layouts/` folder. |
| `@yield`         | Placeholder in the layout file.                |
| `@section`       | Inject content into layout from child views.   |
| `.vel.php`       | VeltoPHP view files must end with `.vel.php`.  |
| `views/layouts/` | Required location for all layout files.        |

```

Final Notes
-----------

Always put your layout files in **views/layouts/** — this is a core part of VeltoPHP's view engine behavior.

The system is intentionally strict to encourage predictable project structure and avoid view resolution issues.
