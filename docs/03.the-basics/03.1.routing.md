Introduction
------------

In web development, routing is the process of determining how an application responds to a specific HTTP request made to a particular URL path.

In **PHP**, routing often involves manually checking 
```bash 
$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] 
``` 
and conditionally including files or calling functions. This approach quickly becomes messy and hard to maintain as the application grows.

**That’s where frameworks like VeltoPHP come in.**

VeltoPHP provides a clean, structured, and readable routing system that maps your URLs to specific controllers and methods. It eliminates the need for manual URL parsing, offering a simple and expressive API to define routes — all in pure PHP syntax.

Whether you're building small projects or large applications, VeltoPHP routing helps you stay organized, scalable, and productive — with minimal boilerplate.

Basic Routing
-------------

**VeltoPHP** supports clean and simple routing definitions without the need for complex configuration files. The most basic routes accept a URI and a controller method to handle the request.

However, VeltoPHP also supports defining routes with inline closures, which is useful for small test routes or quick responses without needing a controller.

```bash
<?php

use Velto\Core\Route;

Route::get('/greeting', function () {
    return 'Hello World';
});
```
This route responds to a GET request to **/greeting** and returns a simple string: **Hello World.**

You can define as many routes as needed using this simple and expressive syntax. Closures are great for prototyping or returning static content, though for production it's recommended to use controllers for better separation of logic.

In **VeltoPHP**, routing is simple and straightforward. You define your web routes in a dedicated routes file **(typically routes/web.php)**. Each route maps a URI to a controller method in a clean, expressive way.

Route Definition
----------------------

Routes in VeltoPHP accept the HTTP method (GET, POST), the URI path, and the target controller with method as a string in the format :
```bash
'ControllerClass::method'
```
You can optionally assign a route name.

```bash
<?php

use Velto\Core\Route;

Route::get('/', 'HomeController::index')->name('home');

Route::get('/contact', 'PagesController::contact')->name('contact');

Route::post('/contact', 'PagesController::contactSend')->name('contact.send');
```

Example with Parameters
-----------------------

Routes can also accept parameters that are passed to controller methods:

```bash
Route::get('/docs', 'DocsController::docs')->name('docs');

Route::get('/docs/{folder}/{file}', 'DocsController::welcome')->name('docs.welcome');
```

In this example, **{folder} and {file}** are dynamic route segments that your controller can access as parameters.

Route File Location
-------------------

All web routes are defined inside your project’s routes/web.php file. This file is automatically loaded by VeltoPHP during application bootstrap. It’s the main place where you define all routes that are accessible via the browser.

Summary

Feature	VeltoPHP Example


Define a GET route	
```bash
Route::get('/', 'HomeController::index')->name('home');
```

Define a POST route	
```bash
