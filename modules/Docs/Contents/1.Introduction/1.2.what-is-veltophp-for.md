# What is VeltoPHP for?

**VeltoPHP** is designed for developers who want to build web applications in a way that’s simple, fast, and flexible — without carrying the weight of unnecessary features or steep learning curves.

If you’ve ever felt that full-stack frameworks like Laravel are too heavy for small or medium-sized projects, VeltoPHP might be exactly what you're looking for. It’s lightweight, modular, and highly customizable — giving you the tools you need, and nothing you don’t.

Whether you're prototyping a new idea, building an admin dashboard, or creating a community-driven platform, VeltoPHP aims to make the process smooth and enjoyable. It strikes a balance between structure and freedom, helping you stay productive without getting in your way.
