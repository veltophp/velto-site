# What is VeltoPHP?

**VeltoPHP** (*especially VeltoPHP V2*) is a lightweight PHP framework that adopts the HMVC concept for its architecture, splitting an application into many small, independent modules. With this approach, every feature is isolated into its own compartment: each module has its own routes, controllers, models, views, and anything else it needs.

# Advantages of HMVC

-   **Modular**  
    HMVC breaks the application into self-contained modules (e.g., Blog, Auth, Forum). Each module keeps its own controllers, models, and views, making the overall project structure neat and organized.
    
-   **Scalable (Easy to Expand)**  
    Because modules are independent, adding new features is safer and simpler—there’s little risk of breaking other parts. This is ideal for large projects or team development.
    
-   **Reusability**  
    Modules can be dropped into another VeltoPHP project with minimal adjustment. For instance, an Auth module can be reused across different projects.
    
-   **Well-Structured**  
    Developers can focus on one module at a time without needing to understand the entire system, which simplifies collaboration.
    
-   **Code Isolation**  
    Bugs or errors in one module are less likely to spread to others thanks to the isolated logic.
    

> Every strength has a corresponding **drawback**, and HMVC is no exception.

# Disadvantages of HMVC

-   **Overkill for Small Projects**  
    For simple applications, the modular structure can feel excessive. Traditional MVC is often faster and more straightforward.
    
-   **More Files and Folders**  
    Because every module carries its own directory structure, the total number of files and folders can balloon compared to plain MVC.
    
-   **Less Common**  
    Major frameworks such as Laravel or CodeIgniter still default to classic MVC, so newcomers may struggle to grasp how HMVC works.


# So Why HMVC ?

Most **frameworks** stick to a flat, simple structure, but VeltoPHP chooses HMVC because we believe that building an application is not just about code—it’s about peace of mind. By slicing every feature into small, self-contained modules, you can focus on one piece at a time without juggling the entire system in your head. It feels calmer, tidier, and far less stressful.

**VeltoPHP** doesn’t use HMVC to follow the crowd; it’s the approach that makes the most sense for how most developers actually work: start small, one module at a time, until it all grows into something big. For us, HMVC isn’t just architecture—it’s a way to keep coding fun. Whether you’re hacking on a personal side-project or shipping a professional application, you can move forward with confidence. One module first, no rush.
