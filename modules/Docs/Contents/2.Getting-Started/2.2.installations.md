# Getting Started

Once you've completed everything in the **Pre-requisites** section, you're fully equipped to start using **VeltoPHP** in your next web project.

VeltoPHP is a lightweight and developer-friendly framework built specifically for those who want to create clean, structured, and fast web applications without the overhead of large, complex frameworks. Whether you're working on a small prototype, a community project, or a custom backend system — VeltoPHP is designed to get out of your way and let you build.

The framework is based on the **HMVC (Hierarchical Model-View-Controller)** architecture, which promotes modular development. This structure makes your codebase more organized, easier to scale, and more maintainable over time.


# Let's Begin the Installation

To get started, the first step is to open your terminal or command prompt.

Then, type the following command to begin installing VeltoPHP:

```bash

composer create-project veltophp/velto new-velto

```

> Make sure you're in the directory where you want your new project to be created.

> 💡 Note: Internet Connection Required for Tailwind CSS

**VeltoPHP** by default uses the Tailwind CSS CDN to style its default views. This means the styles are loaded directly from the internet using a Content Delivery Network (CDN).

To ensure that your VeltoPHP project looks and works as expected, please make sure your computer is connected to the internet while developing or viewing the application in the browser.

> If you prefer to work offline or want more control, you can always replace the CDN with a local build of Tailwind CSS.
