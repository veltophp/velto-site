# Front End View

In VeltoPHP, the front-end rendering is powered by a lightweight templating engine using the .vel.php file extension. This custom view engine, known as Vel-View, is specifically developed for VeltoPHP and designed to be both intuitive and efficient.

Much like Laravel’s Blade, Vel-View provides a familiar and expressive syntax for embedding dynamic data into HTML. You can output variables using:

```bash
# example

{{ $data }}    # Automatically escaped (safe for HTML output)
{!! $data !!}  # Unescaped (raw HTML output)

```

# Directive Replacements
This is the heart of the compiler in your templates and replaces them with equivalent PHP code.

```bash

#Layout & Section Control

@extends('layout')        →   Set a layout

@section('content')         →   Start a section
@endsection               →   End a section

@yield('content')          →   Output a section’s content

@include('view')          →   Include another view

```

```bash

# Control Structures

@if(condition)            →   if ()
@elseif(condition)        →   else if ()
@else                     →   else
@endif                    →   end if

@foreach(...)             →   foreach loop
@endforeach               →   end of foreach

@forelse(...)             →   foreach with empty check
@empty                    →   what to show if empty
@endforelse               →   end of forelse

@for(...)                 →   for loop
@endfor                   →   end of for

@while(...)               →   while loop
@endwhile                 →   end of while

@php                      →   open <?php
@endphp                   →   close ?>
```

```bash

# Error Handling

@error('email')           →   Check for validation errors
@enderror                 →   Close error display
```

```bash

# Auth Helpers

@auth                    →   If user is logged in
@endauth

@guest                   →   If user is NOT logged in
@endguest
```


```bash

# CSRF

@csrf                    →   Outputs CSRF token field
```


```bash

# Flash Info

@flash_info(#id)        →   Show specific flash message with spesific ID
```

```bash

# Active Links

@active('dashboard')     →   Outputs `active()` for menu highlighting
```


```bash

# Special Tag Handling

@component('name') → Includes a reusable component.

@role('admin') → Only shows content for users with specific roles.

@end_role → Ends the @role block.
```

```bash

# Echo Output Replacements

{{ $data }}             →   Escaped HTML output using `htmlspecialchars`
{!! $html !!}           →   Unescaped raw HTML
```


# Final Output
Once all replacements are done, the template has been converted into pure PHP, which can be cached and rendered efficiently.


# Why This Matters
This compiler allows you to:
- Write cleaner views using readable syntax
- Avoid mixing raw PHP in HTML
- Maintain consistency and security (e.g., auto escaping {{ }})


# View Directives Are Still Evolving
VeltoPHP's custom view engine (**.vel.php**) is a powerful and lightweight solution for building front-end templates. While many directives such as **{{ $data }}**, **{!! $html !!}**, **@if**, **@foreach**, and layout sections are already functional, the entire directive system is still under active development and refinement.

***If you encounter any bugs, unexpected behavior, or missing features in the view system, we welcome your feedback***. Please consider:
